# Aleo ZK-DCA Project Structure Rules

# Project Directories
/contracts - Aleo smart contracts
/src/main - Main application code
/resources - Static resources and configuration files
/scripts - Deployment and utility scripts

# Development Workflow Rules
1. Always implement contracts in the /contracts directory
2. Use the arcn_pool_v2_2_4.aleo program for DEX interactions
3. Front-end components should be in /src/main
4. Keep program logic separated by functionality
5. Test scripts should start with "test_"
6. Document all functions with clear comments
7. Follow Aleo's privacy best practices

# Nomenclature Rules
- Contract names should be descriptive and end with .aleo
- Use snake_case for variable and function names
- Use camelCase for front-end components
- Prefix private variables with "private_"

# Implementation Order
1. Define core data structures (records, mappings)
2. Implement DCA setup functions
3. Implement withdrawal functions
4. Implement DEX integration
5. Build front-end components
